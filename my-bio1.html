    <p class="bio-intro"> <strong><em>Apart from his carrier, his passion and target has been unto young generation (Youths), Shapping and inducing
          positive and genuine mind-set which will help them face challenges in this modern world. He strongly believe that, youths are the ones who hold strength, therefore its a logistic reason that, imposing them with good attitudes and
          positive mind-set will more likely help in
          shapping this modern world we are now in (directly or indirectly), and hence forth make it a better place of living. Also, its significant to note that, youths are the main work force, so leading them to apply their strength positively will eventually bring positive results to the society, rather than if they apply on the negatives.</p></em></strong></p>
